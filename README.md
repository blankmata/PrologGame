In order to run the game, I first installed SWI-Prolog application for easy testing of the game. (https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) This of course, isn’t required it just made coding and testing easier. In the command line you will run:
?- csci4342_HW4.pl.
But if you are usiing SWI-Prolog simply select File > Consult.. and then select csci4342_HW4.pl to open it.
Once the file has been selected enter:
?- start.
In order to begin the game.

After typing the start command you will be greeted with the help file, I will also share it here for easy access.
